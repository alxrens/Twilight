    `Exactly why you don't have it. Speculate harder. Don't you like that anyway?  🤡`,
    `Open Editions will continue today. 1:00-1:15 PM ET  Remember, your NFTs will be minted based on the total cubes you own after the final auction.  So, if you get 5 cubes (Day 1) and 5 more (Day 2) you get "Ten Cubes" (1 NFT).  You are still in the fungible zone. Consider that.  🤡`,
    `Now you know about the idea. Wait for Burn to take it's final shape.  I am glad you like it.`,
    `I start with 0 ashes. Just like any other user.  If token holders decide to spend ashes they obtain for my releases, I can earn $ASH. Just like any other user.`,
    `Burn has halving. As $ASH supply increases, it becomes harder to obtain $ASH by burning. Halves every million.  Burn favors featured tokens which generate many times more $ASH.  Every featured token is equal to each other. Every other token is equal to each other.`,
    `Tiny correction there! 20k! Not bad right?  #inclusive`,
    `Creation with destruction.  "For every NFT you burn, you get ashes in return."  $ASH #ERC20`,
    `Fungible &gt; Nonfungible &gt; Fungible`,

    `Just made the first Burn. I have 1000 ashes now.  Soon you will reach the app, too.  #ERC20`,
    `The next announcement is not about the collection. It's about the ecosystem.`,
    `Should've said 1000.`,
    `Are you watching?  I will tease you something when we have 100 retweets.  Let me play the social media game since we all accept digitally native now.  🤡`,

    `Calm down, open editions are 1 hour away. ;)`,
    `&lt;3`,
    `Hush.`,
    `Ouch`,
    `Oh what the`,
    `The transformation will be from bigger to smaller.  So, 25 cubes will give you "Twenty Cubes" + "Five Cubes" NFTs.  Not 25 x "A Cube" NFTs.`,
    `Collectors, speculators, investors, tell me, how will you play this one?`,
    `Therefore, number of "sold" cubes will not showcase how many of each individual Open Edition NFT is produced.  Together, we will see, at the end.  And of course, the value is never only about the number of NFTs you own, but also about which ones they are.`,
    `The amount of cubes you obtain will determine the set of NFTs you will receive at the end of the 3 days.  Ex:  Obtaining 67 fungible cubes will give you 6 NFTs: "Fifty Cubes" "Ten Cubes" "Five Cubes" "A Cube" "A Cube"  But obtaining 500 will give you 1 NFT: "Five Hundred Cubes"`,
    `Less than 6 hours for The Oracle and the guesses are all pretty wild.`,
    `Hundreds of "good luck" emails, I see it all and will respond.  Thank you 🙏`,
    `Almost there, this one.`,

    `Next: The Twist ;)`,
    `Back to hype. 10 minutes.`,
    `Oh and finally:  No. The last 1/1 isn't the last rabbit in this hat. But at least you will see fully, what's known as a "collection".   Performance continues.`,
    `Now it's time to make statements, prove existence, validate a medium. We'll be there together.  &lt;3`,
    `Prior to the launch, let me make it known that this was a surprise for me. I feel honored to be a part of the future of this community, and even more to have made so many brilliant friends as well.`,

    `Hunters, the scene is watching you. Who is going to be The Hunter? (Equilibrium #2)`,
    `We have many candidates for The Oracle (Equilibrium #4).  Who will be the one?`,
    `Yes, the owner decides to keep it the way it is, or, to use it.   The owner has to announce publicly that they're using The Switch.  Remember, once used, it can never go back.  "Do not press the red button."`,

    `This thread is me, trying to understand if I'm missing anything here. I will be very happy if I do.`,
    `So provided options: using sidechains, using other networks, and so on, are not really helping with the carbon footprint.  They are only adding to what's already active with the exact same footprint with or without the additional TX created by the NFTs: ETH mainnet.`,
    `Moreover, I believe, by creating NFTs we give investors another option to invest.  This means they create a lot less TX's for the amount of value they invest in compared to a usual "trader" in this sense.  This means, NFTs cause less consumption by letting people invest bigger.`,
    `In other words "No NFTs on mainnet" does not reduce energy consumption. Mainnet is always 100% load.  It MAY reduce gas fees if % of NFT related tx are high in ratio.. but then again, processing, electricity, &amp; carbon footprint will remain the same... as long as ETH is alive.`,
    `As far as the concept goes, the more we need TX, the more expensive they become.  It's very much like the "render farm" concept, where the energy consumption remains the same during workload, but the prices increase as more people need it.  The privileged one the highest payer.`,
    `From a technical point, blocks (ETH) are consuming the same energy with or without NFTs.. or additional TX.  The processing power and the energy consumption remains the same, that's why "gas fee" goes crazy.  So tell me, how will "no NFTs" help support green?`,

    `Oh one more thing..`,
    `👌 this close to an announcement. Let's build the hype.  ✖️`,
    `Here it starts.`,
    `To collect or create NFTs you will be using platforms.. So you are essentially using "web" - "web3" to be specific.  So you need a "web3" wallet.. A wallet that will be able to connect "web3 enabled" websites through your browser.`,
    `You could, very well, use your favorite song's lyrics as your "private key" and use the hash generated with it as your "wallet address" but is it really safe? What if someone tries the same data.  This is why it's almost a tradition to start with a generated data as your key.`,
    `Others can always see your hash.. aka "the wallet address", but they will never know what data produced it. So, in blockchain terms, they will never own it, as they can't prove its origins.  This is why you keep your private key safe, because, it's a proof of ownership.`,
    `And this is the basics of a blockchain wallet..  A blockchain wallet is a hash of some data, which is known as "the private key".`,
    `But here is the catch:  If you have the hash, you can not figure out which data produced that.  In other words, hash is a one way encoding. You can get the same hash from the same data, but you can not generate the data back from the hash.`,
    `A hash is a unique identifier of a data. The same data produces the same hash.  Why is this valuable?  This way we can compare big data without comparing them bit by bit. We compare the hashes, because we know that the same data produces the same hash.`,
    `..but you still do not know where to start. What's this all about? How do you take your first step?  The essential first step is to understand what blockchain is.. but that, too, will happen in time.  So I want to try explaining what a crypto wallet is..`,

    `Of course just like in any economy some things* have the bubble effect. It's investors' wisdom to identify what is permanent and what is temporary, just like any other investment opportunity.  So, how do you decide if something is "worth the money" or not?`,
    `"NFT is not real."  It is, since actual and virtual are both real.  It's more real than that valuable in game item you think you have in your inventory.  It's more real than your Netflix account that brings cinema to your home.  It's more real than your bank account balance.`,
    `"Art" always requires certain decisions.  Today minting costs more than printing making it similar to physicality.  Furthermore all NFTs are not "art", the scene is much wider.  That's why I think "crypto artist" isn't a right term, we should use "crypto creator" instead.`,

    `There is also the "drive" factor. An influencer that talks about crypto (or ML) will definitely drive a lot of people in. Without a single creation the influencer can cause a lot more damage in that case.`,

    `Blockchain is a developing technology and it's surely not at it's optimal point. Just like how machine learning is not, and how AI dev can burn down a good amount of planet as well.`,
    `In other words, it's invalid to shame the art.`,
    `Considering the amount of artworks reaching to the masses, cryptoart is still a valid option in comparison to physical collectibles. It's true, producing for the masses always has a cost, but that, too, is not a cryptoart native thing*.`,
    `So, compared to the alternative parallel universe where "crypto" still exists but "art" doesn't, would the CO2 emission decreased?  Considering how "expensive" cryptoart can be, we can expect more TX without it for the same trade-value created here.`,
    `TX carbon footprint is a problem when the artwork is created/collected.  Considering that the majority of collectors are coming from crypto world, that majority would invest into other crypto-native things if there was no cryptoart. Altcoins, tokens, tech, and so on.`,
    `Looking at the recent arguments about cryptoart carbon footprint: many valid points out there. This was already a discussion of "crypto" but is this really related to the "art"?`,

    `Thank you, all, for your kind words. It's amazing to be in this community of creation.`,
    `So, design your art.`,
    `Shortly;  "Create things that will communicate a value of why you* should be in their* collection"`,
    `Be (yourself).`,
    `Innovate.`,
    `Communicate your value.`,
    `Create value.`,
    `So, here is a TLDR of my humble opinion(s) about this new medium:`,
    `Every work I've released so far had a conflict or a question, they tried to push one thing or another.  It may be technical, it may be social, or it may be directly related to the market itself or the way auctions work. It may be about anything.  But I believe, "this is the way."`,
    `..and value* is generally a very social thing.`,
    `It's all about the value in the end. And this is the tough, invisible part.`,
    `And also, yes, this is a marketplace. So value* is another topic to consider.  How do you see your work? How do you want others to see it?  If you had to buy one of the two random things in front of you, which one would you pick? How would you pick it? Why?`,
    `So you need exploration.  You need innovation.  You need to figure out how to reach someone else and tell a story, tell about a concept, tell about why your thing* is valuable and hopefully they will make sense of it!`,
    `You may target the likeminded people - "the people who understand this, will understand me."  Fine, do that. But still, you need to communicate.`,
    `Create pieces that communicate.  Do it your way, do it your style, but, in the end, it has to be understood.  Remember, it's a product. A product of you, in form of an artwork. Connections are important, even if it's personal.`,
    `In other words "if I like this, then someone else will" but also that "someone else" needs to understand it.  So, here comes the "communication design" part of it.`,
    `Every thing* has an audience, even the most unplanned one. I am never on the side of creating something only because someone else may* want it - but I do think, focusing on what you do the best and bringing the best out of it to stage is a good recipe for success potential.`,
    `In other words, having a designer mindset is a big plus, because after all, you're not just creating something, you're creating something for a target audience.  This means, what you create is a product*  I know, I know, it's disturbing to think of it like this, but bear with me.`,
    `In other words, yes, tokenizing old works makes a lot of sense from a blockchain/history point of view, which I sometimes do, and will keep doing - but also, designing* something new for this brand new medium that explores new paths, is vitally important.`,
    `First of all, I see this as a new medium rather than a new marketplace. This shapes a lot of things in my work(s).  A new medium means new ways of communication to begin with.`,
    `I do not think I am, in any way, in the position to give suggestions to others in this new medium, cryptoart.  No one is.  However, I can share my ideas. Everything is personal, but, I will try to provide as many points as possible for an approach of success..`,

    `I believe, in the end, it's always about how the question is asked.  A sincere wonder about a technique is different than a creator-ignorant request of the tool-that-does-it-all.`,
    `My favorite one is "which software created that?"`,
    `Creators: Do you find it offensive when others ask you what tools you are using to create?  "Oh that's a beautiful image, what camera do you use?"`,

    `So many amazing things happening right now. How many of them can you spot?`,
    `So it seems my crypto scene presence so far has not been heavy enough to be invited into some valuable major public events arranged by the authorities.  Gatekeeping is hard on this one.  Time to change that.`,

    `Everyone who is in the creative NFT space that can't deal with the "huge sales" of "this is not an artwork, this is a product" situation: If you can't deal with a basic insurance, how will you deal with xxx business when it hits NFTs?  Remember, NFTs are not made for one thing.`,
    `Do you miss that time when you had time?`,

    `..however I'm planning to expand to more platforms, which will give me deeper insights to understand the dynamics of this complex interaction map.`,
    `I'll be releasing more personal insights about these topics soon. As I'm limited to only one platform (primarily) at this point, I can only base my personal data depending on my personal experience..`,
    `Shortly, from my personal perspective it is not only a basic balance between Scarcity and Abundance but more of a social balance that can be reverse engineered by analyzing the crowd behavior in a wider sense, with more data.`,
    `Circle Existence can be determined by many things, not only social media followers of course. Event activities, private channels even geography in the real world.`,
    `This brings me back to "2. Approval" once again, as, those "notable agents" have the right follower base with them for the correct reach.`,
    `In other words, a person with 5 followers can be more effective on a circle compared to a person with 500 followers, if those 5 followers were notable agents in that specific circle or target audience.`,
    `And finally 3. Circle Existence - you see, sometimes higher social media reach does not mean higher niche reach - as the "circle existence" is far more valuable to effect that specific social circle.`,
    `I believe this public data is an important metric to determine the fulfilled potential of a work's platform reach and can be used to estimate success/value.`,
    `With the use of (thankfully) social media, we can estimate this approval value depending on the number of interactions/mentions made by those "notable agents".`,
    `This is important, because, this creates an active topic of "the new one" in those entangled closed social circles - which increases the potential value of releases.`,
    `2. Approval - The "new creator" or "released work" should get the approval of "notable agents" - such as other creators, collectors, or more importantly the platform(s).`,
    `This bring me back to "Team Abundance",as, to learn timing well, one has to make many trial and errors.`,
    `Timing is far more important than ever - as we're creatures of social feeds and never-ending data streams, to create these moments of encounter, timing should be perfect.`,
    `1. Timing - The same creation being released 10 times could have only 1 successful - and that would be because of better timing.`,
    `I believe there are far more important factors that define success and I would like to bring a few of them to this nice debate:`,
    `With the current metrics that are available to every one of us, it seems easy to make up correlations between number of works and amount of success (?).`,
    `Additionally, checking these charts in that debate of "Top Selling Artists" I feel like I have to drop a few lines and charts about that section as well.`,
    `The correlation will drop over time and finally popularity will be a metric of reach rather than value.`,
    `However, cryptoart isn't that big yet, the general audience of cryptoart is still far from the absolute general - therefore currently popularity and value should be more correlated than ever.`,
    `I believe I may have a point of view related to the discussed concepts in this informative debate.`,
    `For all those that need faster hardware to reduce work time:  Faster hardware does not reduce work time. Faster hardware gives you a change to make more trial and errors.  It increases perfection.`,

    `Just like that, would it be art without the cameras, without the spotlights, without the crowds and applause? Would it be art without the frame and the exhibition?`,
    `Watching films, I've always wondered, "If the camera didn't look at it, would I?" Would it be significant enough to make my head turn and force my eyes to focus? Or am I only looking because the camera tells me so?`,

    `Shortly, the market™ needs small, functional, beautiful cases. Good designs for specific targets.  Not bulky copycats with minimal innovation, created with the fear of rejection.`,
    `Case X ™`,
    `Case X. Ok. We have a brand.`,
    `Already have a lot going on in my design lab, maybe a separate chamber for "how to create the perfect case for case X" could be a nice research topic.`,
    `Or better, a case movement.`,
    `See, this thread will end up me starting a case company.`,
    `For instance, I know I can fit 4GPU's in a much smaller space than a building size ugly object/thing.`,
    `Instead of producing a single case that will "bind them all in the darkness", a good brand has to create a line of simpler cases that are easier to produce with much less customization, each serving a specific purpose.`,
    `What's the solution?`,
    `Even an enthusiast has to make a pick from many bad designs.`,
    `And no real target audience for a product.`,
    `Every brand seems to be taking the easy path, trying to figure out what everyone else may prefer.  No bold decisions. No good design.`,
    `If a brand is so much into customization, they need to give the option to customize things before they're packaged, during the shopping. It's not hard to design a modular case that's packaged and sent just as needed.`,
    `"Customization" is the primary ingredient in this motivation, however, you don't "customize" a workstation many times after you put it together.`,
    `Every major brand seems to follow"bigger is better" ideology for "airflow" excuse but imo it's a bad design decision.`,

    `Archillect makes me and a vast majority of people who are aware of the project, happy. She tries to fulfill its main purpose: to inspire.`,
    `Undeserved? I wouldn't say that though. Only surprising.`,
    `I have to tell you at this point: I was not expecting this as well. We're on the same page.`,
    `And this becomes a problem it as they* feel this is undeserved.`,
    `For those, I feel, the real problem is not about attribution at all.`,
    `Almost in the level of public flaming.`,
    `As a side effect of these facts, I find myself questioning the true motivation of minority that are not-so-nicely asking for this.`,
    `In other words when the attribution issue is stated nicely, I can nicely answer: "I'm aware. I'd like to have a technical solution as well."`,
